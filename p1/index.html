<h1>Project 1 -- multi-threaded programming</h1>
<!-- Worth: 3 points<br> -->
Assigned: September 14, 2022<br>
Due: September 27, 2022

<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This project will give you experience writing multi-threaded programs
using monitors: mutexes and condition variables.  In this project, you
will write a simple concurrent program that schedules disk requests.
Your concurrent program will use a thread library that we provide.

<p>
<strong><font color="#FF0000">This project is to be done
individually.</font></strong>

<h2>2. Thread library interface</h2>

<p>
This section describes the interface that the thread library provides
to applications.  The interface consists of five
classes: <tt>cpu</tt>, <tt>thread</tt>, <tt>mutex</tt>, <tt>cv</tt>,
and
<tt>semaphore</tt>, which are declared in <a href=cpu.h><tt>cpu.h</tt></a>,
<a href=thread.h><tt>thread.h</tt></a>, <a
href=mutex.h><tt>mutex.h</tt></a>, <a href=cv.h><tt>cv.h</tt></a>, and <a
href=semaphore.h><tt>semaphore.h</tt></a> (do not modify these files).  For
convenience, <a href=thread.h><tt>thread.h</tt></a> includes the other
header files.

<p>
To use the thread library, <tt>#include <a href=thread.h>thread.h</a></tt>
and link with <a href=libthread.o><tt>libthread.o</tt></a>.

<h3>2.1. <tt>cpu</tt> class</h3>

<p>
The <tt>cpu</tt> class is declared in <a href=cpu.h><tt>cpu.h</tt></a> and
is used mainly by the thread library.  The only part used by applications
is the <tt>cpu::boot</tt> function:

<pre>
    static void boot(thread_startfunc_t func, void *arg, unsigned int deterministic);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>cpu::boot</tt> starts the thread library and creates the initial
thread. The thread library embodies this first thread by invoking the
function pointed to by <tt>func</tt>, passing the single
argument <tt>arg</tt>.  A user program should call <tt>cpu::boot</tt>
exactly once, before calling any other thread
functions.  <tt>cpu::boot</tt> does not return.

<p>
<tt>deterministic</tt> specifies if the thread library should be
deterministic or not.  Setting <tt>deterministic</tt> to zero makes
the scheduling of threads non-deterministic, i.e., different runs may
generate different results.  Setting <tt>deterministic</tt> to a
non-zero value forces the scheduling of threads to be deterministic,
i.e., a program will generate the same results if it is run with the
same value for <tt>deterministic</tt> Different non-zero values
for <tt>deterministic</tt> will lead to different results; this can be
helpful when debugging.

<p>
Note that <tt>cpu::boot</tt> is a <tt>static</tt> member function and
is not invoked on an instance of the <tt>cpu</tt> class. See the
example program below for the proper syntax.

<h3>2.2. <tt>thread</tt> class</h3>

<p>
The <tt>thread</tt> class is declared in
<a href=thread.h><tt>thread.h</tt></a>.

<p>
The constructor creates a new thread.  The thread library causes this
new thread to begin execution by invoking the function
pointed to by <tt>func</tt>, passing it the single
argument <tt>arg</tt>.

<pre>
    thread(thread_startfunc_t func, void *arg);
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>join</tt> method causes the calling thread to block until the
thread denoted by the method's object has exited.  If the specified
thread has already exited, <tt>join</tt> returns immediately.

<pre>
    void join();
</pre>

<h3>2.3. <tt>mutex</tt> class</h3>

<p>
The <tt>mutex</tt> class is declared in
<a href=mutex.h><tt>mutex.h</tt></a>.

<p>
The constructor is used to create a new mutex. Recall that mutexes are
free at the time of instantiation.

<pre>
    mutex();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>lock</tt> atomically waits for the mutex to be free and acquires
it for the current thread. If multiple threads are contending for a
mutex, the thread library ensures that only one will acquire it at a
time. You may not assume anything about the order in which contending
threads acquire the mutex. 

<pre>
    void lock();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>unlock</tt> releases the mutex.  Throws <tt>std::runtime_error</tt>
exception if the invoking thread does not hold the mutex.

<pre>
    void unlock();
</pre>

<h3>2.4. <tt>cv</tt> class</h3>

<p>
The <tt>cv</tt> class is declared in <a href=cv.h><tt>cv.h</tt></a>.

<p>
The constructor is used to create a new condition variable.

<pre>
    cv();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>wait</tt> atomically releases mutex <tt>m</tt> and waits on the
condition variable's wait queue.  When the thread is awakened, 
<tt>wait</tt> will attempt to re-acquire <tt>m</tt> as if by
callling <tt>lock</tt>; when it does so successfullly, wait returns
to the calling thread  with the mutex held.  Throws
<tt>std::runtime_error</tt> exception if thread does not hold the
mutex <tt>m</tt> on invocation. Note that threads may
awaken <i>spuriously</i>, without a corresponding call to signal or
broadcast, and you can make no assumptions about the time between a
thread awakening and attempting to re-acquire the mutex <tt>m</tt>.


<pre>
    void wait(mutex& m);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>signal</tt> awakens one of the threads on the condition queue. If
multiple threads are waiting, you may not assume anything about the
order in which signal awakens threads.

<pre>
    void signal();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>broadcast</tt> awakens all of the threads on the condition
queue. If multiple threads are waiting, you may not assume anything
about the order in which awoken threads are scheduled.

<pre>
    void broadcast();
</pre>

<h3>2.5. <tt>semaphore</tt> class</h3>

This class is provided so you can try programming with semaphores in
lab or on your own.  Use locks and condition variables (not
semaphores) for Project 1.

<p>
The <tt>semaphore</tt> class is declared in
<a href=semaphore.h><tt>semaphore.h</tt></a>.

<p>
The constructor is used to create a new semaphore and initialize it to
the specified value.

<pre>
    semaphore(unsigned int initial_value);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>down</tt> atomically waits for the semaphore to be positive and
decrements it.

<pre>
    void down();
</pre>

<p>
<tt>up</tt> atomically increments the semaphore.

<pre>
    void up();
</pre>

<h3>2.6. Scheduling and Termination</h3>

<p>
When a thread is eligible for execution, we say that the thread
is <strong>ready</strong>. When more than one thread is ready, the thread
library makes no guarantees about which ones will be selected to run
or what their relative rates of progress will be.

<p>
When a thread is waiting in one of <tt>join</tt>, <tt>lock</tt>,
<tt>wait</tt>, or <tt>down</tt> we say the thread
is <strong>blocked</strong>. Blocked threads do not consume CPU. When
a thread becomes blocked, another ready thread is selected to run if
any such threads exist. If no ready threads exist, the thread library
exits and your program terminates.

<p>
When more than one thread is waiting to acquire a lock, you may not
make any assuptions about (a) which thread will be woken up to attempt
to acquire the lock in response to a call to <tt>unlock</tt> or (b)
how much time elapses between being woken up and making that
attempt. In particular, a thread that is not waiting for the lock at
the time of <tt>unlock</tt> may acquire it before any waiting threads
do.

<p>
When more than one thread is waiting on a condition variable, you may
not make any assumptions about (a) which thread will be woken up in
response to a call to <tt>signal</tt> or (b) how much time elapses
between being woken up and attempting to re-acquire the
lock. Likewise, you may not assume the order in which a set of waiting
threads will be scheduled in response to a call to <tt>broadcast</tt>.

<p>
When more than one thread is waiting in a call to <tt>down</tt>, you
may not make any assumptions about which thread will be woken up in
response to a call to <tt>up</tt>.


<h3 id="example">2.7. Example program</h3>

<p>
Here is a short program that uses threads.

<hr>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "thread.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

mutex mutex1;
cv cv1;

int child_done = 0;		// global variable; shared between the two threads

void child(void *a)
{
    char *message = (char *) a;
    mutex1.lock();
    cout << "child called with message " << message << ", setting child_done = 1" << endl;
    child_done = 1;
    cv1.signal();
    mutex1.unlock();
}

void parent(void *a)
{
    intptr_t arg = (intptr_t) a;
    mutex1.lock();
    cout << "parent called with arg " << arg << endl;
    mutex1.unlock();

    thread t1 ((thread_startfunc_t) child, (void *) "test message");

    mutex1.lock();
    while (!child_done) {
        cout << "parent waiting for child to run\n";
        cv1.wait(mutex1);
    }
    cout << "parent finishing" << endl;
    mutex1.unlock();
}

int main()
{
    cpu::boot((thread_startfunc_t) parent, (void *) 100, 0);
}
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Here are the <strong>two</strong> possible outputs the program can generate.

<hr>

<pre>
parent called with arg 100
parent waiting for child to run
child called with message test message, setting child_done = 1
parent finishing
No runnable threads.  Exiting.
<hr>
parent called with arg 100
child called with message test message, setting child_done = 1
parent finishing
No runnable threads.  Exiting.
</pre>
<hr>

<h2 id="diskscheduler">3. Disk scheduler</h2>

<p>
Your task for this project is to write a concurrent program that
issues and services disk requests.  Use monitors (mutexes and
condition variables) for synchronization; do not use semaphores.

<p>
The disk scheduler in an operating system receives and schedules
requests for disk I/Os.  Threads issue disk requests by enqueueing
them at the disk scheduler and waiting for them to be serviced.  The
disk scheduler queue can contain at most a finite number of requests
(<tt>max_disk_queue</tt>); this limit is passed as a command line
argument to your program. Threads wishing to make requests must wait
if the queue is full.

<p>
Your program will create of a set of threads: one <strong>servicer</strong>
thread and a number of <strong>requester</strong> threads. The number of
requester threads will be inferred from the command line arguments.
Each requester thread should issue a series of requests for disk
tracks; these are specified in an input file. The names of these files
are passed as arguments to your program.  Each request
is <strong>synchronous</strong>; a requester thread must wait until
the servicing thread finishes handling that requester's current request
before that requester issues its next request.  A requester thread
finishes after all the requests in its input file have been serviced.

<p>
Requests in the disk queue are <strong>not</strong> necessarily
serviced in first-come, first-served order.  Instead, the service
thread handles disk requests in <strong>shortest seek time first</strong>
(SSTF) order.  That is, the next request it services is the request
that is closest to its current track.  The disk is initialized with
its current track as 0.

<p>
Keep the disk queue as full as possible; your service thread should only
handle a request when the disk queue has the largest possible number of
requests.  This gives the service thread the largest number of requests to
choose from, which in turn helps minimize average seek distance.  Note that
the value of "the largest possible number of requests" varies depending on
how many requester threads are still active.  When at least
<tt>max_disk_queue</tt> requester threads are active, the largest possible
number of requests in the queue is equal to <tt>max_disk_queue</tt>.  When
fewer than <tt>max_disk_queue</tt> requester threads are active, the largest
number of requests in the queue is equal to the number of living requester
threads.  A requester is considered to be active from the time the program
starts until all its requests have been serviced.

<p>
<!--
Over reasonable time intervals (say, enough time for each requester
to issue several requests), your program should be unbiased in which
requester gets to issue a request when there is space on the disk queue.
-->
Your program should not force a particular order on which requester should
get to issue a request when there is space in the disk queue; this should
depend solely on the speed of the threads and the scheduling of mutexes
and condition variables.

<h3 id="input">3.1. Input</h3>

<p>
Your program will be called with several command-line arguments.  The first
argument specifies the maximum number of requests that the disk queue can
hold.  The rest of the arguments specify a list of input files (one input file
per requester).  I.e., the input file for requester r is argv[r+2], where
0 <= r < (number of requesters).  The number of threads making disk requests
can be inferred from the number of input files specified. 

<p>
The input file for each requester contains that requester's series of requests.
Each line of the input file specifies the track number of the request (0 to
999).  You may assume that input files are formatted correctly.

<h3 id="output">3.2. Output</h3>

<p>
In the critical section where a requester thread issues a request for a
particular <tt>track</tt>, that requester thread should call
<tt>print_request(requester, track)</tt>.  A request is available to be
serviced after <tt>print_request</tt> returns.

<p>
In the critical section where the service thread services a request
for a given <tt>track</tt> by a given requester, the service thread
should call <tt>print_service(requester, track)</tt>.  A request is
considered to have been removed from the queue after
<tt>print_service</tt> finishes.

<p>
<tt>print_request</tt> and <tt>print_service</tt> are declared in <a
href=disk.h>disk.h</a> (do not modify this file) and included in <a
href=libthread.o><tt>libthread.o</tt></a>.

<p>
Your submitted program should not generate any other output. You may
find it helpful to add debugging output while testing your program,
but it should be disabled or removed before submission.

<h3 id="exampleio">3.3. Example input/output</h3>

<p>
Here is an example set of input files (disk.in0 - disk.in4).  We recommend
you download these files, rather than copy-pasting the contents into
an editor, since some editors create malformed files when you copy-paste
(e.g., missing newline character for the last line).

<table border=1>
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th><a href=disk.in0>disk.in0</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in1>disk.in1</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in2>disk.in2</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in3>disk.in3</a></th>
        <th><a href=disk.in4>disk.in4</a></th>
    </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
	<td>785<br>53</td> <td>350<br>914</td> <td>827<br>567</td> <td>302<br>230</td> <td>631<br>11</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Here is one of many possible correct outputs from running the disk
scheduler with the following command (the final line of the output is
produced by the thread library, not the disk scheduler):

<pre>
scheduler 3 disk.in0 disk.in1 disk.in2 disk.in3 disk.in4
<hr>
requester 0 track 785
requester 1 track 350
requester 2 track 827
service requester 1 track 350
requester 3 track 302
service requester 3 track 302
requester 4 track 631
service requester 4 track 631
requester 1 track 914
service requester 0 track 785
requester 3 track 230
service requester 2 track 827
requester 0 track 53
service requester 1 track 914
requester 4 track 11
service requester 3 track 230
requester 2 track 567
service requester 0 track 53
service requester 4 track 11
service requester 2 track 567
No runnable threads.  Exiting.

</pre>

<h3>3.4 Tips</h3>

<p>
The best way to write a correct solution is to think carefully about
the structure of your program in the face of concurrency. In
particular:

<ul>
<li> Every "action" in your program should be a thread body. There are
(at least) two actions: make a disk request, and service a disk
request. Every "actor" in your program should be an instantiated
thread. There are (at least) N+1 actors: N requesters, and one
servicer.</li>

<li> Identify shared state, and assign a lock to (each group of) this
state.</li>

<li> Identify critical sections by noting regions within which
invariants are broken or over which state dependencies exist. Acquire
the appropriate lock before a critical section starts, release it
after it ends. Consider using RAII, thinking carefully about the scope
of such objects.</li>

<li> Identify any ordering constraints: situations in which one thread
needs another to perform some action before it can continue. Encode
that action as a boolean expression over shared state, and assign a
condition variable to each condition, associated with the appropraite
lock.</li>

<li> In the "waiting thread," wait on that condition variable inside a
while loop that checks the boolean expression.</li>

<li> In the "doing thread," call either signal or broadcast after
performing the work for which the waiting thread is waiting. Call
signal if (a) <strong>any single</strong> waiting thread can make
progress AND (b) <strong>only one</strong> of them can. Call broadcast
if EITHER (a) <strong>some</strong> waiting threads cannot make
progress OR (b) <strong>more than one</strong> waiting thread
can.</li>

<li> The only statement inside the waiting loop (other than debugging
print statements) should be <tt>wait</tt>.  No state should be changed
inside a waiting loop or evaluating its boolean expression, nor should
a thread call <tt>signal</tt> or <tt>broadcast</tt> within the loop.
No thread should be affected by another thread calling <tt>wait</tt>.

<li> Locks should be used only to enforce mutual exclusion.  Condition
variables should be used only to enforce happens-before
constraints. Do not use these mechanisms to try to influence the order
in which things happen in any other way.

<li> Favor simple, clear solutions over complex ones that might (or
might not) be slightly faster. Make liberal use of the allowed
libraries. Use <tt>assert</tt> whenever possible to make errors
fail-stop.  Remember the elements of good style you have learned in
prior courses: Do not duplicate code if a funciton can encapsulate it,
and provide clean abstraction boundaries.
</ul>

<p>
Of course, we will all make mistakes as we do this, so having a
testing plan is important. There are three main approaches to testing
a concurrent program.

<p>
<strong>Deterministic cases.</strong> Design both expected and edge
cases for requesters making requests. Call <tt>cpu::boot</tt> with a
specific deterministic seed. Verify the answer is correct. It can be
helpful if you have a single-threaded program that checks output for
correctness automatically by simulating the behavior of a "correct"
disk scheduler given a sequence of requests.

<p>
<strong>Short non-determinsitic cases</strong> Create a small number
of short, random test cases. Run them repeatedly,
calling <tt>cpu::boot</tt> with non-determinisim enabled. Verify the
output is correct for each run. For these test cases, it will be even
more helpful to have a program that automatically verifies output;
checking these by hand can be tedious. It can also be helpful to write
a tool that can repeatedly invoke your non-deterministic solution on a
particular input set, and perform the verification step
automatically. Many people use shell scripts or python to create such
a tool.

<p>
<strong>Long stress tests</strong> Create a VERY LARGE random test
case--many thousands of requests is not too long. Run it repeatedly
with <tt>cpu::boot</tt> set up to allow non-determinism. For these
test cases it will be impossible to check the entire output by hand,
so verifying it as correct requires another program. However, you
might find segfaults, deadlocks, or other "hard" failures that
illuminate errors in your program. You can can also do simpler things
with simple tools: for example, you might use <tt>grep</tt>
and <tt>wc</tt> to make sure that the right number of requests were
issued and serviced for each thread. You might also
use <tt>awk</tt>, <tt>sort</tt>, and <tt>uniq</tt> to check that each
track number appears the correct number of times in the output
compared to the number of times it appears in all of the inputs.

<h2 id="logistics">4. Project logistics</h2>

<p>
Write your disk scheduler in C++17 on Linux.  Use the default CAEN
compiler to compile your programs.  At the time of this writing, that
is 8.5.0. Note that you may have a different default version
via <tt>module load</tt> left over from a prior course.

<!--<pre>
module load gcc/9.1.0
</pre>
-->

<!--
<p>
You should also set the <tt>LD_BIND_NOW</tt> environment variable to 1.
This works around an apparent incompatibility between the thread library
and the Linux dynamic linker.  Add the following line to your
<tt>~/.profile</tt>:

<pre>
export LD_BIND_NOW=1
</pre>
-->

<p>
You may use any part of the standard C++ library, except the C++
thread facilities.  You should not use any libraries other than the
standard C++ library.  Your disk scheduler code may but need not be in
multiple files.  Each file name must end
with <tt>.cc</tt>, <tt>.cpp</tt>, or <tt>.h</tt> and must not start
with <tt>test</tt> (filenames that start with
<tt>test</tt> will denote test cases in later projects).

<p>
<strong>To avoid conflicting with the C++ thread facilities, do not
specify "using namespace std;" in your program.</strong>

<p>
Here's a simple <a href=Makefile>Makefile</a> that shows how to compile a
disk scheduler (adjust the file names in the Makefile to match your own
program).

<p>
You are required to document your development process by having your
Makefile run <tt><a href=autotag.sh>autotag.sh</a></tt> each time it
compiles your disk scheduler (see Makefile above).  <tt><a
href=autotag.sh>autotag.sh</a></tt> creates a git tag for a compilation,
which helps the instructors better understand your development process.
<tt><a href=autotag.sh>autotag.sh</a></tt> also configures your local git
repo to include these tags when you run "<tt>git push</tt>".  To use it,
download <tt><a href=autotag.sh>autotag.sh</a></tt> and set its execute
permission bit (run "<tt>chmod +x autotag.sh</tt>").  If you have several
local git repos, be sure to push to github from the same repo in which you
compiled your disk scheduler.

<p>
When running <tt>gdb</tt>, you will probably find it useful to direct
<tt>gdb</tt> to ignore <tt>SIGUSR1</tt> events (they are used by the
project infrastructure).  To do this, use the following command
in <tt>gdb</tt>:
<pre>
handle SIGUSR1 nostop noprint
</pre>

<p>
We have created a private <a href="https://github.com/eecs482">github</a>
repository for each student
(<tt>eecs482/uniqname.1</tt>)
Initialize
your local repository by cloning the (empty) repository from github, e.g.,

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:eecs482/uniqname.1
</pre>

<h2 id="grading">5. Grading, auto-grading, and formatting</h2>

<p>
To help you validate your programs, your submissions will be graded
automatically, and the results will be provided to you.  You may then
continue to work on the project and re-submit.  The results from the
auto-grader will not be very illuminating; they won't tell you where
your problem is or give you the test inputs.  The main purpose of the
auto-grader is to help you track progress towards completion.  The
best way to debug your program is to generate your own test inputs,
understand the constraints on correct answers for these inputs, and
determine if your program's output obeys these constraints.  This is
also one of the best ways to learn the concepts in the project.

<p>
You may submit your program as many times as you like, and all submissions
will be graded and cataloged.  We will use your highest-scoring submission,
with ties broken in favor of the later submission.  You must recompile and
<tt>git push</tt> at least once between submissions.

<p>
The auto-grader will provide feedback for the first submission of each day,
plus 3 bonus submissions over the duration of this project.  Bonus
submissions will be used automatically--any submission you make after the
first one of that day will use one of your bonus submissions.  After your 3
bonus submissions are used up, the system will continue to provide feedback
for the first submission of each day.  

<p>
Because you are writing a concurrent program, the auto-grader may return
non-deterministic results.
<!--In particular, test cases 4-7 are non-deterministic.-->

<p>
Because your programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to follow the
exact rules in the project description.  In particular:

<ul>

<li>Your program should print only the two items specified in
<a href="#output">Section 3.2</a>.

<li>Your program should expect several command-line
arguments, with the first being <tt>max_disk_queue</tt> and the others
specifying the list of input files for the requester threads.

<li>Do not modify or rename the header files provided in this handout.

</ul>

<!--
<p>
In addition to the auto-grader's evaluation of your program's correctness, a
human grader will evaluate your program on issues such as the clarity and
completeness of your documentation, coding style, the efficiency, brevity, and
understandability of your code, etc..  Your final score will be the product of
the hand-graded score (between 1-1.12) and the auto-grader score.
-->

<h2 id="submission">6. Turning in the project</h2>

<p>
<!--<a href=../submit.php?1>Submit</a> the following files for your disk scheduler:
-->
You will submit the following files for your disk scheduler:


<ul>

<li>C++ files for your disk scheduler.  File names should end in
<tt>.cc</tt>, <tt>.cpp</tt>, or <tt>.h</tt> and must not start with
<tt>test</tt>.  Do not submit the files provided in this handout.

</ul>

There is a strict deadline for full credit on the project: Midnight
EDT on the day the project is due. Students who have obtained less
than 80% at that point may continue working on the project for up to
one week to improve their score to a maximum of 80%, with additional
help from the course staff.

<!-- <p> -->
<!-- The official time of submission for your project will be the time of your -->
<!-- last submission.  Submissions after the due date will automatically use up -->
<!-- your late days; if you have no late days left, late submissions will not be -->
<!-- counted. -->

<h2 id="platforms">8. Experimental platforms</h2>

<p>
The files provided in this handout were compiled on RHEL 8.  They should
work on most other Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu) and on Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL), but these are not officially supported.

<p>
We also provide a version of the infrastructure for students
who want to develop on MacOS (10.14 or later, including experimental
support for ARM-based Macs).
<!--
The infrastructure works around a bug in
MacOS's low-level context functions (which are deprecated) and there may be
other bugs lurking, so use this at your own risk.
-->
If you are developing on MacOS:

<ul>
<li>Use <tt><a href="macos/libthread_macos.o">libthread_macos.o</a></tt> instead of
<tt>libthread.o</tt>.

<li> Add <tt>-D_XOPEN_SOURCE</tt> to the compilation flags.

<!--
(note the different suffix).

<li>If you run the project in a debugger, you'll need to ignore SIGUSR1
signals by issuing the following debugger command:

<pre>
process handle SIGUSR1 -n false -p true -s false
</pre>

To issue this command automatically, add it to <tt>.lldbinit</tt> or create
a symbolic breakpoint on <tt>main</tt> and give it a Debugger Command
action that continues automatically after evaluating the actions box.
